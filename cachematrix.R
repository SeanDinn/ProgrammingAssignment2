## This function will take a matrix and invert it. It will first test to make sure it has not 
## already been inverted. If it has, it will retreive the matrix from a cache

## This function will create a matrix, calculate the inverse and cache it

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This function will determine if the input matrix has been inverted. If it has, it will 
## retrieve the inverted matrix from the cache. If not, it will invert the input matrix
